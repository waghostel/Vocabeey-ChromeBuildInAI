      <p>
        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or
        conversations?"
      </p>

      <div class="book-image">
        <img
          src="alice in wonderland.png"
          alt="Alice in Wonderland illustration"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
        making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        close by her.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
        very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh
        dear! I shall be late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it
        occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
        it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch
        out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
        Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
        never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
        take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
        after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
        rabbit-hole under the hedge.
