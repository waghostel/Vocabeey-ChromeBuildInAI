## Overview

AI-powered systems can adapt over time. Prepare users for change—and help them understand how to train the system.

This chapter covers:

- Which aspects of AI should we explain to our users?
- How should we introduce AI to the user initially—and thereafter?
- What are the pros and cons of introducing our AI as human-like?

## What's new when working with AI

A mental model is a person's understanding of how something works and how their actions affect it. People form mental models for everything they interact with, including products, places, and people.

However, users' mental models may not always match what a product can actually do. Mismatched mental models can lead to unmet expectations, frustration, misuse, and product abandonment.

Key considerations:

**➀ Set expectations for adaptation.** AI allows for more systems to adapt, optimize, and personalize to users. Building on the familiarity of existing mental models can help users feel comfortable.

**➁ Onboard in stages.** When introducing users to an AI-powered product, explain what it can do, what it can't do, how it may change, and how to improve it.

**➂ Plan for co-learning.** People will give feedback to AI products, which will adjust the models and change how people interact with them. Users' mental models will similarly change over time.

**➃ Account for user expectations of human-like interaction.** People are more likely to have unachievable expectations for products that they assume have human-like capabilities.

## ➀ Set expectations for adaptation

Most products are highly static. With AI becoming more prevalent in products and experiences, we can expect to see more experiences that change in response to users. One of the biggest opportunities for creating effective mental models of AI products is to build on existing models, while teaching users the dynamic relationship between their input and product output.

### Identify existing mental models

Start by thinking about how people currently solve the problem that your product will use AI to address. That existing solution will very likely inform their initial mental model for your product.

### Key concept

To understand the context for the user's relationship to your AI product, work through questions like:

- What is the user trying to do?
- What mental models might they carry over to your product?
- What is the step-by-step process that novice users currently use to accomplish the task?
- How uniform is this process between different users?

## ➁ Onboard in stages

Onboarding is the process of helping a new user or customer get to know a product or service. The onboarding experience begins before users purchase or download your product and continues indefinitely.

### Introduce and set expectations for AI

After identifying your users' existing mental models, imagine how information your user received before their first interaction with the product has shaped their expectations. Collaborate closely with your marketing team to develop appropriate and consistent messaging.

Messaging guidelines for setting the right expectations:

- Be up-front about what your product can and can't do
- Offer examples of how it works that clarify the value
- Let people know up-front that it may need their feedback to improve
- Communicate why people should continue to provide feedback

### Explain the benefit, not the technology

Make sure to evaluate which details users need to build a good mental model. If they're interested in understanding the underlying technology, you can always provide more detail with tooltips and progressive disclosure.

### Only introduce new features when needed

Use relevant and actionable "inboarding" messages to help users along. Try to avoid introducing new features when users are busy doing something unrelated.

### Design for experimentation

Many people learn best by tinkering with a new experience. By keeping onboarding short, you'll let them get right to it. Suggest a low-risk or reversible action they can try right away.

#### Key concept

Onboarding messaging framework:

This is { your product or feature }, and it'll help you by { core benefits }. Right now, it's not able to { primary limitations of AI }. Over time, it'll change to become more relevant to you. You can help it get better by { user actions to teach the system }.

## ➂ Plan for co-learning

Because AI-powered products can adapt and get better over time, the user experience can change. Users need to be prepared for that, and adjust their mental model as necessary.

### Connect feedback with personalization

In onboarding, let users know how the feedback they provide helps the AI personalize their experience. There are two ways to collect feedback:

**Implicit feedback** is when people's actions while using the product help improve the AI over time. There should be a place in your product where users can see which signals are being used.

**Explicit feedback** is when people intentionally give feedback to improve an AI model. This kind of feedback can help the user feel more in control of the product.

### Fail gracefully

The first time the system fails to meet expectations, the user will likely be disappointed. However, if the mental model includes the idea that the system learns over time, then failure becomes an opportunity to establish the feedback relationship.

### Remind, reinforce, and adjust

Sometimes products become part of a user's everyday routine, so their mental models get formed and reinforced by ongoing use. But some products are only meant to be used occasionally.

You can help strengthen mental models by:

**Keep track of user needs**: Monitor how the product is being used. Reviewing your product logs can show you behavior or use trends that point to user confusion or frustration.

**Adapt to the evolving user journey**: If how a feature works changes or improves significantly, consider whether your users need "re-boarding" to the new experience.

## ➃ Account for user expectations of human-like interaction

A number of products have launched in recent years that are designed to be anthropomorphic or human-like. This choice has advantages and disadvantages that should be weighed carefully.

When users confuse an AI with a human being, they can sometimes disclose more information than they would otherwise, or rely on the system more than they should. Therefore, disclosing the algorithm-powered nature of these kinds of interfaces is a critical onboarding step.

### Clearly communicate AI limits and capabilities

People may struggle to form an accurate or useful mental model of an anthropomorphized AI-powered product because the way these systems execute tasks is inherently different than the way a person would.

Choose the level of humanization based on how well your AI's capabilities match the user's perceptions of what a human can do.

### Cue the correct interactions

Leveraging human characteristics to build mental models is particularly useful if your product interactions rely on distinctly human behaviors, such as conversation. Using the first person in chatbots and voice interactions can help people intuitively understand how to use your system.

However, if your conversational AI refers to itself as "I", the corresponding user mental model includes near-perfect natural language processing, which your AI may not be able to pull off yet.

## Summary

Mental models for AI-driven products are influenced by multiple factors including: existing mental models for similar features or products, marketing messages from your team, onboarding and expectations setting, and the feedback relationships in your product.
