[Intro]
Hey everyone! Today I'm going to show you Vocabeey - a Chrome extension that turns any article you're reading into a language learning tool. It uses Chrome's built-in AI to detect languages and translate, so you can highlight words and sentences, and they instantly become flashcards with audio. Whether you're learning your second or third language, this makes real content your best teacher. So let me show you how it works.

[ ]

[Getting Started]
First, when you're on any webpage, just click the Vocabeey extension icon to extract the article. Sometimes you'll see some extra content being captured. You can switch to edit mode here, and you can remove anything you don't need before you start reading. Since we haven't introduced the AI content cleaning feature yet, I recommend doing this first to keep your learning materials as clean as possible.

[Highlighting Made Easy]
To highlight vocabulary or sentences, you can click on these buttons to switch between vocabulary mode or sentence mode. Or if you prefer to use hotkeys, just press 1 for vocabulary, 2 for sentences, and 3 for none mode. As you're reading, you can highlight any words you don't know or sentences you really like. If you made a mistake during highlighting, you can switch to None mode, select a part of the paragraph, and click remove to delete them all at once.

[Interactive Flashcards]
All your highlights will automatically turn into flashcards down here at the bottom. Click on any word or sentence, and you can hear how it's pronounced. You can switch between showing your learning language or your native language. Everything is organized as flashcards so you can review them easily later.

[Smart Language Detection]
Chrome's AI automatically figures out what language the article is in. But if you find it detected the wrong language, just right-click on the article card and select the correct one. You can also change your translation language anytime you want, and boom - all your flashcards update instantly to match.

[Closing]
Oh, and one more thing - you can switch between dark and light themes depending on what's comfortable for you. There's also a built-in tutorial that walks you through mostly everything if you need it. So that's Vocabeey! Start turning real articles into your personal language lessons today.
