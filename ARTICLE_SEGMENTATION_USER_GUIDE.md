# Article Segmentation - User Guide

## What is Article Segmentation?

Article Segmentation automatically breaks long articles into smaller, manageable parts (typically 300-700 words each). This makes it easier to read and learn from lengthy content without feeling overwhelmed.

## How to Use

### Navigation Buttons

At the bottom of the reading interface, you'll find navigation controls:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Previous    Part 2 of 5    Next →           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Previous Button (←)**: Go to the previous part
- **Next Button (→)**: Go to the next part
- **Part Indicator**: Shows your current position (e.g., "Part 2 of 5")

### Keyboard Shortcuts

For faster navigation, use these keyboard shortcuts:

- **← (Left Arrow)**: Previous part
- **→ (Right Arrow)**: Next part

> **Tip**: These shortcuts work anywhere on the page, except when you're typing in an input field or editing text.

## Features

### 1. Part-Specific Content

When you navigate between parts, you'll only see:

- **Article text** from the current part
- **Vocabulary cards** highlighted in this part
- **Sentence cards** highlighted in this part

This keeps your learning focused on one section at a time.

### 2. Position Memory

The extension remembers which part you were reading:

- Close the tab and reopen it → Returns to the same part
- Refresh the page → Returns to the same part
- Position is saved for up to 1 hour

### 3. Empty State Hints

If a part has no vocabulary or sentences yet, you'll see helpful hints:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  No vocabulary items in this part yet.      │
│  Highlight words in the text above to       │
│  add them as vocabulary.                    │
│                                             │
│  Part 3 of 5                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Smooth Transitions

When you navigate between parts:

- Content fades in smoothly
- Page automatically scrolls to the top
- Cards update to show only relevant items

## Example Workflow

### Reading a Long Article

1. **Open Article**: Extension processes and segments the article
2. **Start Reading**: Begin with Part 1
3. **Highlight Words**: Add vocabulary as you read
4. **Navigate**: Click "Next →" or press → to move to Part 2
5. **Continue Learning**: Each part shows only its own vocabulary/sentences
6. **Return Later**: Your position is saved automatically

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Navigate faster by using arrow keys instead of clicking buttons.

### 2. Review by Part

When reviewing vocabulary:

- Go to Vocabulary mode to see all words from all parts
- Return to Reading mode to review words part-by-part

### 3. Focus on One Section

Don't try to learn everything at once. Focus on mastering one part before moving to the next.

### 4. Check Part Numbers

The part indicator helps you track progress through long articles. Use it to plan your learning sessions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How are articles divided into parts?

**A**: Articles are automatically segmented into parts of approximately 500 words each, respecting paragraph boundaries.

### Q: Can I jump to a specific part?

**A**: Currently, you can only navigate sequentially using Previous/Next buttons. A "jump to part" feature may be added in the future.

### Q: What happens to my highlights when I navigate?

**A**: Your highlights are saved with the part where you created them. They'll reappear when you return to that part.

### Q: Can I see all vocabulary from all parts?

**A**: Yes! Switch to "Vocabulary" mode (click the 📝 tab or press 'v') to see all vocabulary items from the entire article.

### Q: Why can't I navigate during editing?

**A**: Navigation is disabled while editing a paragraph to prevent accidental data loss. Save or cancel your edit first.

### Q: How long is my position saved?

**A**: Your current part position is saved for 1 hour. After that, the article will open at Part 1.

## Troubleshooting

### Navigation buttons are disabled

- **Previous button disabled**: You're on the first part
- **Next button disabled**: You're on the last part
- **Both buttons disabled**: You're editing a paragraph (save or cancel first)

### Position not restored

- More than 1 hour has passed since you last viewed the article
- Browser session storage was cleared
- You're viewing a different article

### Cards not showing

- Make sure you're in Reading mode (not Vocabulary or Sentences mode)
- Check that you've highlighted words/sentences in the current part
- Try navigating to a different part and back
