## done

[x] Add delete on sentence card
[x] Divide the article into sections (Article Segmentation Feature)

Summarizer API - Could create article summaries
Rewriter API - Could adapt content to difficulty level (this is actually a core feature that's coded but not exposed!)
Prompt API (Vocabulary Analyzer) - Could show difficulty levels and generate example sentences
Architecture is solid - Three-layer design (UI → Background → Offscreen) makes it easy to enable these features

Low-hanging fruit:

Language detection: 1-2 hours to enable
Article summarization: 4-6 hours
Difficulty-based rewriting: 8-12 hours (but it's a core feature!)
